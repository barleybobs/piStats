### Setup
piStats is a display interface for use with **pi-hole** and a **samba server** but because it is coded in python, can easily be modified to display more information.

To setup download the ```setup.sh``` script and ```chmod +x setup.sh```, then click on the file and select run. This will then clone the repository and install the required python packages aswell as the required software.
